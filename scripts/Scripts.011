          BOTANY BOOK
~About Medicinal Herbs~
====
76603
---

Como você deve saber, existem
muitas plantas com qualidades 
medicinais.
Desde a antiguidade, os seres
humanos vem curando suas feridas
e doenças usando várias plantas.
---

As you may know, there are
many plants that have medicinal 
qualities Since ancient times,
humans have been healing
wounds and diseases using
various plants.
====
76763
---

Neste livro, vamos explorar
três dessas ervas que crescem
em torno das montanhas Arklay
e fornecer informações sobre
essas plantas com propriedades
médicas.
---

In this book, we're going to
explore three such herbs that
grow around the Arklay
mountains and provide
information on those plants
with medical properties.
====
76922
---
Cada erva tem uma cor diferente
e um efeito diferente por ser uma
planta medicinal: O verde recupera
a força física, o azul neutraliza
as toxinas naturais, enquanto a
erva vermelha não tem qualquer
efeito por si só.
---
Each herb has a different color
and a different effect as a
medical plant: the green one
recovers physical strength, the
blue one neutralizes natural
toxins, while the red herb does
not have any effect by itself.
====
77135
---

A erva vermelha só é eficaz 
quando misturada com outras
ervas.
Por exemplo, se você misturar
esta erva com a erva que
recupera a força física, o
efeito de recuperação será
triplicado.
---
The red herb is only effective
when it is mixed with other
herbs.
For example, if you mix this
herb with the herb that
recovers physical strength, the
recovery effect will be tripled.
====
77319
---
Ajustando a quantidade e fazendo
experiências com essas três ervas,
você poderá criar vários tipos de
medicamentos, mas vou deixar os
detalhes em suas mãos, porque
essa é a melhor maneira de adquirir
o verdadeiro conhecimento.
---
By adjusting the amount and
experimenting with these three
herbs, you can create various
kinds of medicines but I'll
leave the details in your hands,
because that's the best way
to acquire true knowledge.

9 de Maio de 1998

À noite, eu joguei poker com
Scott, o guarda, e os 
pesquisadores Alias e Steve.
Steve teve muita sorte, mas eu
Acho que ele estava roubando.
Que cretino!
---
May 9, 1998 

At night, I played poker with
Scott the guard, Alias and Steve
the researcher.
Steve was really lucky, but I
think he was cheating.
What a scumbag!
====

10 de Maio de 1998

Hoje um pesquisador do alto
escalão, me pediu para que
tomasse conta de um novo
monstro. 
Parece um gorila sem pele.
---
May 10, 1998

Today, a high ranking
researcher asked me to take
care of a new kind of monster.
They look like gorillas without
any skin.
====
77844
---

Eles me falaram para dar comida
viva a eles. Quando eu atirei
um porco, eles brincaram com o
bicho… arrancando suas patas e
as tripas antes de finalmente
come-lo.
---

They told me to feed them live
food. When I threw in a pig,
they were playing with it…
tearing off the pig's legs and
pulling out the guts before
they actually ate it.
====
78015
---
11 de Maio de 1998

Por volta das 5 horas da manhã,
Scott entrou de repente e me
acordou. Ele estava usando uma
roupa de proteção que parecia
um traje espacial. Ele me disse
para colocar um também.
---
May 11, 1998

Around 5 o'clock this morning,
Scott came in and woke me up
suddenly. He was wearing a
protection suit that looked like
a space suit. He told me to put
one on as well.
====
78199
---

Ouvi dizer que houve um acidente
no laboratório subterrâneo. 
Não me admira, os pesquisadores
nunca descansam, nem mesmo à
noite.
---


I heard there was an accident
in the basement lab. It's no
wonder, those researchers
never rest, even at night.
====

12 de Maio de 1998

Estou usando esta roupa incômoda
desde ontem. Minha pele está 
mofando e sinto muita coceira.
Por vingança, eu não alimentei
os cães hoje. 
Agora me sinto melhor.
---
May 12, 1998

I've been wearing this
annoying space suit since
yesterday, I feel all musty and
my skin is very itchy. By way
of revenge, I didn't feed those
dogs today. Now I feel better.
====
78504
---

13 de Maio de 1998

Fui até a enfermaria, porque
minhas costas estão inchadas e
sinto muita coceira.
---

May 13, 1998

I went to the medical room
because my back is all swollen
and itchy.
====
78588
---

Eles colocaram um grande curativo
em minhas costas e o médico me 
disse que eu não preciso mais
usar aquele traje espacial. 

Acho que poderei dormir bem esta noite.
---

They put a big bandage on my
back and the doctor told me I
did not need to wear the space
suit anymore.

I guess I can sleep well tonight.
====

---
14 de Maio de 1998

Quando acordei esta manhã, 
encontrei outra bolha em meu pé.
Era irritante e eu acabei tendo
que me arrastas quando fui
ao canil. 
---
May 14, 1998

When I woke up this morning, I 
found another blister on my
foot. It was annoying and I
ended up dragging my foot as I
went to the dogs' pen.
====
78886
---

Eles estiveram quietos desde
manhã, o que é estranho. 
Acho que alguns deles escaparam.
Estarei realmente encrencado se
um dos superiores descobrir.
---

They have been quiet since
morning, which was very
unusual. I found that some of
them had escaped.
I'll be in real trouble if the
higher-ups find out.
====

15 de Maio de 1998

Mesmo não me sentindo muito bem,
eu decidi ir ver a Nancy. 
É meu primeiro dia de folga em
muito tempo, mas fui impedido
pelo guarda quando estava saindo.
---
May 15, 1998

Even though I didn't feel well, 
I decided to go to see Nancy. 
It's my first day off in a long 
time. But I was stopped by the 
guard on the way out.
====
79206
---

Ele disse que a companhia havia
ordenado que ninguém saísse da
área. Não posso nem mesmo dar um
telefonema. 
Que tipo de brincadeira é essa?!
---

They say the company has
ordered that no one leaves the
grounds. I can't even make a
phone call.
What kind of sick joke is this?!
====
79339

16 de Maio de 1998

Eu ouvi falar que um pesquisador
que tentou fugir desta mansão foi
baleado na noite passada. 
Meu corpo inteiro parece que está
queimando e coçando à noite.
---
May 16, 1998

I heard a researcher who tried
to escape from this mansion
was shot last night.
My entire body feels burning
hot and itchy at night.
====
79487
---

Quando estava coçando um inchaço
nos meus braços, um pedaço de 
carne podre se soltou. 
Que diabos está acontecendo
comigo?
---

When I was scratching the
swelling on my arm, a lump of
rotten flesh dropped off.
What the hell is happening to
me?
====
79604

19 de Maio de 1998

A febre acabou mas coça. 
Faminto comi a comida do 
cachorro. Coça. Scott chegou.
Cara feia então o matei.
Gostoso.
---
May 19, 1998

Fever gone but itchy.
Hungry and eat doggie food. 
Itchy itchy Scott came.
Ugly face so killed him.
Tasty.

It's a letter. 
The top of the letter is missing. 
The remaining says…
====
79843
---
Sim, estou infectado.
Eu fiz tudo que pudia, mas eu
só consegui retardar a infecção
por mais alguns dias.

Sabe, a coisa mais assustadora é
saber que a cada dia que passa 
eu vou me esquecendo de você.
---
Yes, I'm infected.
I did everything I could, but I
could only delay the progress
by a few days.

The most frightening thing is
that I forget more about you
with each passing day.
====

Então preferi ter uma morte
tranqüila a me tornar um 
morto vivo.

So I'm choosing a peaceful
death, rather than becoming
the living dead.

Minha querida Alma,
 
O fato de você receber esta carta
é tanto uma alegria como uma
tristeza para mim. Eu não podia
nem falar com você por causa
daquele cara de óculos escuros.
---
My dear Alma,

The fact that you have received
this letter is both a joy and a
sorrow for me.
I could not even talk to you
because of that guy in the
sunglasses.
====
80425

Alma, fique calma e leia isso.
Acho que já te disse que mudei
para o laboratório da companhia
farmacêutica. Eles me 
contrataram.

Alma, be calm and read this.

I think I've told you that I
moved to a pharmaceutical 
company's lab. They
headhunted me.

No último mês, houve um acidente
no laboratório e o vírus que
estávamos estudando escapou. 
Todos os meus colegas que foram
infectados pelo vírus estão
mortos.
Para ser mais preciso, se 
transformaram em mortos vivos.
---
Last month, there was an
accident in the lab and a virus
we were studying escaped.
All my colleagues who were
infected by the virus are dead.
Well, to be more accurate,
they've become the living
dead.

Eles ainda vagam por aí. 
Alguns deles estão batendo 
desesperadamente na porta do 
meu quarto agora.

Mas não há sinal de 
inteligência em seus olhos.
---
They still wander around.
Some of them are knocking
on my room door desperately
right now.

But there's no sign of
intelligence behind their eyes.
====
80901
---
Aquele vírus maldito tira todo
o resto de humanidade do homem.
Amor, alegria, tristeza, medo,
humor... tudo para sempre. 

E Alma, até as memórias dos
dias que passei com você...
---
That cursed virus takes away
all humanity from the victim.
Love, joy, sorrow, fear,
humor… all erased.

And Alma, even the memories of
the days I spent with you…
